PacMan Project
HTML and JavaScript project focused on moving Pac Man from one side of the screen to the next, while his mouth opens and closes on a set interval.

Purpose
 To challenge myself in creating functions and calling those functions correctly to move an image accross a screen as part of a basic webpage.
